# mnist-cnn
## Overview
* Trains a convolutional neural network on the mnist data to classify hand drawn images of single digit numbers
* Install imported libraries and run main.py to train and then test the model
* By defualt runs 10 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001 and batch size of 100, all hyperparameter changes will need to be made manually
## Classifying Custom Imanges
To label new images in the custom_images folder after training and testing, follow these steps for the best results:
1. Open the Paint application and resize the canvas to 28x28 pixels.
2. Fill all pixels with black and then create your single digit with a small white brush.
3. Save and add your image to the custom_images folder.
4. On the next run, it should display the name of the image and its attempted classification.
